# nodejs-scraper
Simple web scraper for nodejs

To install dependencies

```js
npm install
```

To start

```js
npm start
```


This will write all the urls to a new sample.txt file recursively.

If you stop and restart the node process, then delete/clear the sample.txt file so that it contains only the new entries.
